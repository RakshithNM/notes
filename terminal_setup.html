<li>

<li>
Install tmux

<li>

<li>

</ol>


<ul>
<li>
Install fzf and ripgrep. Check their project page for installation directions for your platform.

<li>
Add fzf path to vim's runtime path. For ex, if fzf is installed in the home folder called =.fzf=, add =set rtp+=~/.fzf= and restart vim. =:FZF= command should now be available from vim, typing which let's you fuzzy search files in the current directory

<li>
Install the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim</a> plugin which provides a few more wrapper functions that let's you fuzzy search many things like search terms, buffers, marks etc. You can now use =:Files= to fuzzy search files (same as =:FZF= command). Use =:Rg= to search for a term in the files under current directory.

<li>
Make sure autochdir is turned off and :cd or :lcd to project directory for a better project-wide search experience. (edited)
